# Data Report
This file will be generated for each data file received or processed. The Interactive Data Exploration, Analysis, and Reporting (IDEAR) utility developed by TDSP team of Microsoft can help you explore and visualize the data in an interactive way, and generate the data report along with the process of exploration and visualization. 

IDEAR allows you to output the data summary, statistics, and charts that you want to use to tell the data story into the report. You only need to click a few buttons, and the report will be generated for you.
